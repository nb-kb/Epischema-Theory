# Epischema Taxonomy Framework  
A New Paradigm for Understanding Systems and Concepts  

The Epischema Taxonomy Framework is a tool for classifying, exploring, and refining human systems and abstract concepts.
It integrates structural and predictive reasoning to illuminate relationships between ideas, behaviors, and physical continua, fostering understanding across disciplines.

## Purpose  
This project aims to develop a collaborative, open-source knowledge framework to:  
- Refine and validate the taxonomy's principles.  
- Develop a shared glossary of redefined secular terminology.  
- Explore practical applications in fields such as psychology, philosophy, and systems theory.  

## Core Principles  
Epischema Taxonomy describes any system or concept using:  
1. Governance:  
   - Exodelic: Governed by external rules.  
   - Autodelic: Self-regulated or self-created.  
2. Locality:  
   - Local: Fixed to a specific location.  
   - Ubiquitous: Present everywhere.  
3. Temporality:  
   - Generative: Begins and ends, requiring sustenance.  
   - Eternative: No knowable beginning and persists indefinitely.  
4. Physical Continuum:  
   - Abstract (ideas, patterns).  
   - Container (frameworks, systems).  
   - Field (influences, connections).  
   - Matter (physical reality).  

Example classifications:  
- Neural Field: AUE-F (Autodelic, Ubiquitous, Eternative, Field).  
- Proto Brain: AUE-M (Autodelic, Ubiquitous, Eternative, Matter).  
- Collective Consciousness: AUE-C (Autodelic, Ubiquitous, Eternative, Container).

## Get Involved  
We welcome contributions to refine, validate, and expand the framework.  

### How to Contribute 
1. Fork the Repository: Clone a copy to your GitHub account.  
2. Explore the Framework: Review documentation and examples.  
3. Submit Ideas or Issues: Propose new terms, test classifications, or raise questions.  
4. Pull Requests: Submit improvements or expansions to the framework.

### Planned Features 
- Comprehensive Glossary: Redefining dogmatic terminology into secular and intuitive concepts.  
- Use cases in psychology, philosophy, and technology.  
- Collaborative experiments to validate the taxonomy's principles.
